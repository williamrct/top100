# top100
Hello, Note from William the author and submitter.

This is not my best body of work but given the time crunch I am confortable with the submission as a way of demonstrating my ability to follow a requirements document and deliver a working app.

Application design:

Shared instances:
  1. Network availability - NetworkConnectionManager
  2. Web services REST API calls - WebServiceManager
  3. ImageLoader - Asynchronous Image Loading and Caching

ViewController
  1. Top 100 Album List View Controller - AlbumListViewController
  2. Select Album Details View Controller - AlbumDetailViewController

Model:
  1. Top100AlbumsViewModel
  2. Top100AlbumFeed

Helper:
  1. AlbumCollectionViewLayout
  2. Extensions

This was a quick attempt to satisfy the requirments.  There is a lot that can be done to improve the code and the exception handling. 

I spent about 5 hours on this assigment.  

Thank you for the opportunity to participate.

Cheers 

William
